BRIEF NOTES ON THE OPERATION OF TURNTABLES IN OPEN RAILS


Full instructions are in the Open Rails manual but these brief notes will allow you to get turning.

1. When you are close to the turntable, change to manual mode with <CTRL>M.

2. Center the loco and tender on the turntable and ensure that reverser and regulator are all at zero and brakes are fully applied.

3. Turn the loco clockwise with <ALT>C. Stop rotation when the first rail of the turntable is just past the first rail of the track on which you intend to exit.  It can be moved anticlockwise with <CTRL>C.

4. Drive off the turntable.

5. Leave manual mode with <CTRL>M and continue.

If this is being used in an activity, place a reversing point immediately before the turntable.  Your path must be written such that you can rejoin it after exiting the turntable.
