A list of the activities included with the Chiltern route
========================================================= 

These activities have been selected to show off the largely fully sceneried parts of the route. Other activities will be added as the further placement of scenery in the route progresses.

The first activity in the list is by David Forrest.  All the other activities are by Richard Stevenson.  They both have my sincere thanks.

Golf Special -  Drive a "special" to Denham Golf Course for a fete and return later in the evening.

An Evening at Princes Risborough - Spend an evening at Princes Risborough watching the passing traffic.

Bakerloo Rush Hour - Take a service from Stanmore as far as Baker Street at the height of the evening peak timetable.

Banbury-Princes Risborough Auto - An early morning autotrain service from Banbury as far as Princes Risborough.

Chiltern Court Coal Turn - A rare electric freight working on the Metropolitan.

Football Special - With a football match taking place between two local sides, extra trains have been put on to take supporters from Banbury to High Wycombe.

Great Central Inner Suburban - A short run on a Saturday from Marylebone to West Ruislip in the 1950s.

Milk to Marylebone - Take over the severly delayed overnight milk train at Banbury and work it forward to Marylebone.

Slipping at Bicester - An early evening express from Paddington to Wolverhampton in the late 1950s that also conveys the slip coach dropped at Bicester.

World Cup Shuttle - It's 30th July 1966 and you are operating one of the shuttle services from Marylebone to Wembley stadium.

Since this route is a work-in-progress, from time to time you will see activities that are designed solely to check the ongoing work on the route.  These activities will include "Test" in their name and are not intended for normal use.
