PROTOTYPE
~~~~~~~~~~

In the early days of the railways, liquids were carried by ordinery opens and vans in barrels, carboys and casks etc. It was not until the growth of the gas industry that sufficiant quantities of tar were produced to fill a wagon.
The first tank wagons were rectangular or D shaped - just a metal box on a wooden underframe.  Cylindrical tanks followed but there was a problem: Liquids cannot be fixed down and tend to keep moving when the tank stops. Strong bracing was required to secure the tank and it was some time before an agreed design evolved.
The first RCH specification in 1887 was for a cylindical tank with a central dome housing the filler and discharge aperatus.  Double "T" end bracing and wire ropes looped around the dome stopped any lengthways movement and vertical staps held it down.

Variations were allowed and it was not until 1907 that a full specification was issued.
This was for a tank 5ft 8in diameter and 17ft 5in long resting on an underframe 18ft long with 10ft6 wheelbase.
Longitudinal cradle or crossways saddle mounts were allowed as was wooden or steel frames.
The tank could carry 10tons of class B fuel oil or 12 tons of class A motor spirits.
Bottom discharge was banned for class A tanks resulting in additional vents and syphon valves on the top.

There was soon a demand for higher cappacity and in 1911 the tank diameter was increased to 6ft7in which could carry 14 tons. At the same time wooden chassis were banned for class A.

The next change was in 1927 when the then standard steel underframe of 17ft6in with a wheelbase of 9ft was adopted. This required the end bracing to be cranked out to fit the tank. The end bracing was by then steel and strong enough to render the wire ropes unnecessary and horizontal tiebars were substituted.
The large dome was replaced by a smaller loading hatch and the vent and bottom door handwheel (siphon valve on class A) were now outside.
At some time in the 30s the wheelbase was changed to 10ft but the design was little changed until the war.

During WW2 an urgent need was found to supply fuel for fighter aircraft and bombers flying from new airfields "somewhere in England" Large numbers of class A tanks were built and most had small platforms and later ladders added to assist access. After the war these Air Ministry wagons were sold to the oil companies and many were converted to class B.

In 1944 a new method of fixing the tank was approved. This had a steel plate at an angle riveted to the tank and the frame top and flanked by steel saddles. It was known as the anchor mount. No end bracing was used.

The availability of cheap Air Ministry wagons meant that few new wagons were built until the radical change to high cappacity fitted wagons in the 60s.

Livery
~~~~~~~~~
The oil companies tended to buy wagons in small batches as the business expanded, This resulted in considerable variation in a typical consist. Tank wagons had long lives and elderly wagons lasted well into the 60s

Shell and BP combined distribution in 1932.
The class A tanks for liquids with a flash point below 23degrees (Mainly petrol) were regulation silver with a red strip at the centreline of the tank. During the war this was too easy a target and they were repainted mid grey.
In 1947 watime restrictions were lifted and the red stipe was moved to the sideframes.
The tanks had large SHELL lettering on one side and BP on the other.
In the mid 50s smaller emblems replaced the large letters but the company kept the wagons clean and few required to be repainted.
The class B wagons for liquids with a flash point between 23degrees and 60 degrees (Diesel and fuel oil) had no regulation livery but, due to the nature of the load the only practical livery was black.
The White SHELL  --BP-- lettering was little changed in the history of the wagons.
A star painted on the tank indicated that the wagon could travel at 45 MPH.

Repaints
~~~~~~~

Due to the considerable variations in detail in these wagons, please contact me before attempting a repaint.
Give as much detail as possible and preferably a picture and I will try to provide a good match.
I am keen to see more tank wagons - I can't do them all.
