These are reskins of David Robinson's original, many thanks to Dave for permission and thanks to Rick Gibb for updating the engine and tender.

The two cylinder sound set (ID:2910 and 2919) is required along with the crew aliases ID 7759 and 7703.

Note that all four individual locos and the tender can have their lamps configured. Go to folder Lamps for details.

These locos were allocated to nearby Neasden (14D) until that shed closed in 1962 when they moved to Cricklewood.
 
Here are the numbers and the coupling type.


76040	Automatic
76041	Chain
76042	Automatic
76043	Chain
