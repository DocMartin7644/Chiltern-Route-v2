Model : BR exLMS cattle wagons
Version: 1
Released : 17th March 2006
Author : Ian Macmillan
With thanks to Chris Heighton for allowing the use of his coos and sheepies.


PROTOTYPE.
Built by the LMS to diagram 1661 from 1923, these wagons were a continuation of a Midland order. 4338 wagons were built up to 1932.
They were unbraked but some were given thru vacuum pipes.

Construction continued with diagram 1840 which had an identical body but was given 8 shoe vacuum brakes.
Variation occured with both diagrams, mainly in the hight of the drop door.

As the livestock trade declined, many of these wagons were used for ale traffic.
They were withdrawn around 1960.

The model is a replacement for my existing model. The pack also contains 2 additional models;
A piped only wagon and an unfitted version.
All have several loads.

Two low poly versions are also included for use in static consists.

Loads for these wagon are stored in the common.loads and are aliased from the wagon file.
