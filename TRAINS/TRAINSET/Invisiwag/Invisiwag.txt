Invisible wagon.


Version 2

By Ian Macmillan.


The invisible wagon designed to carry a freight animation which can be anything such as a load, lamps, headboard etc. The animation can be shifted to place it anywhere required.

A vacuum piped and an air piped version are provided.
You can change the coupling by modifying the entry in the .wag file.


Version two uses an new shape file after I was informed the the earlier version cast a shadow.
The new version is very small and sits just under the rail. It is a single poly with a LOD of 1 metre.
It needs no texture - it aliases to a texture in the main MSTS folder.

I make no claim on ownership of this file. Anyone could make one so save yourself the bother and use this one instead. The small size is unimportant - its takes it's size from the .wag or .eng file.
