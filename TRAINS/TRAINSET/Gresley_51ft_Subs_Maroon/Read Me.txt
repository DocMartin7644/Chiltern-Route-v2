These coaches are not 100% accurate. they are a representation of the real thing.
The coaches in this pack are based off the Hornby OO scale coaches,
as well as reference photo's on the internet.

An especially big thank you must go to Ian Macmillan,
who's help in doing the textures made this project a reality a lot faster.

A big thank you to all in the MSTS community who's hard work and
dedication provided me with the insparation to have a go at these coaches.
