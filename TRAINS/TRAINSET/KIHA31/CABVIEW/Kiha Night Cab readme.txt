Night and Rear Cab View for the Default Kiha 31.

This adds a night and rear cab to work with the default Kiha 31 using the MSTS Bin upgrade available from http://mstsbin.uktrainsim.com/

You must have the patch installed before installing this file.

This patch will automaticaly switch between night and day cabs at sunset and sunrise and in tunnels.
By pressing Key 1 twice you can switch to the rear cab and drive from it with fully working controls.

I have included  aliased cvf files as well as modified consists .
INSTALLATION.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unzip to a temporary folder and drag, move or copy the Kiha31 folder to your trainset folder. Allow to overwrite if asked. Drag, move or copy the Consists folder to your Trains folder and again overwrite.

Inside the Kiha31 folder is an Aliased folder. This contains aliased kiha31.cvf files.
Copy these to any loco which uses the the Kiha 31 cab.

To add the rear cab to an existing consist, add 100 to this line....

NextWagonUID ( 10 )

so that it reads....

NextWagonUID ( 110 )

You will also have to make this change to any other consists you make.
Without this change, the rear cab will look out from the rear of the leading vehicle.


Have fun,
