Many thanks to Reg Furniss for allowing these reskins taken from his 5100 Class BR Green Loco 5199.


This is a set of twelve of these locos. 


The locos require the two cylinder sound set and the Prairie Tank Cabview (UKTS ID 2910 and 8519). To install the Cabview unpack the Prairie Cab Zip file to a temporary location and rename the directory Tanker to Cabview. Then copy this into the BR6100 Multipack directory.

These locos were built for the London area suburban traffic and as such are ideal for the London end of the Paddington Penzance.
