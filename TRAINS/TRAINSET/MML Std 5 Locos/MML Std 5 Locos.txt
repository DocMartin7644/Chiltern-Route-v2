This is a pack of eight Standard 5 locos that were associated with the line out of St Pancras.

They are renumbers of David Robinson's originals and thanks to him for permission. Thanks also to Rick Gibb for updating the engine and tender files.

The two cylinder sound set (File ID:2910 and 2919) is required as well as the crew alias (File ID: 7759 and 7703).
