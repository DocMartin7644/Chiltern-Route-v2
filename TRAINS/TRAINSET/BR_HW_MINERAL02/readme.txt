INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the

Copy or move the folder BRMINERAL02 into the \TRAINS\TRAINSET directory.

You are now ready to create a consist containing this model by using the Activity Editor
supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator - the model will not be available in the simulator unless you do this.

Please be aware that this model may or may not be compatible with all the engines and rolling stock that you 
have available.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.

NOTE

The wagon is `unfitted` ie. has no train brake , but has a through vacuum pipe to ensure compatability with other stock.
