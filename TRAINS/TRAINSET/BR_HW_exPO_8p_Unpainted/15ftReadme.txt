Prototype.

The railway Clearing house introduced it's first standard design in 1888.

It was for an 8 ton 15ft by 7ft 2in 6 plank mineral wagon. 
By the time of its introduction axle and spring materials had improved and many were built or rebuilt as 10 ton wagons with an additional plank to allow for the increased capacity.

The design was superceded by a 16ft wagon in 1907 but the 15ft type continued to be built where there were clearance restrictions.

This model represents a late build example which has been rebuilt with oil axleboxes.
The type survived due to wartime shortages but most were completely worn out by the end and few lasted to be taken over by BR.
However, many remained in private internal use into the 60s.
Two models are included. - a worn one in traditional livery with blackened metalwork and script small lettering, and a more recent style repaint.

Each has 3 different loads.
