Unzip the contents of the zip file into the trains folder the default path of which is c:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\Trains\Trainset providing you have 'use folder names' ticked the contents should end up in a Sub folder called Britannian. Now create a consist, I use ConBuilder and you should be up and running. The model uses default cab and sounds for the Scotsman so that needs to be installed.

Be warned the model has a high poly count the tender has 9,569, The main model 18,900 and the CabPlus has 5,280. The cabplus is a freight anim which adds the cab detail plus bits and pieces or additional detail which for some reason I couldn't get into the main model. More importantly this also adds the cab overhang which fits over the top of the front of the tender.

The model was made with TSM and I set out to include as much detail as possible. I used polymaster to split the main model in to sub-objects but for some reason I still hit some sort of limit which was poly or texture related. the test I did sugested it was more a problem with the number of polys but I may be wrong. 

At some future date  I may add some LOD's and try a bit harder to cull some excess polys, I may also create a later variant and a Clan but at the moment I am sick of the sight of the thing. The animation is slightly incorrect a problem with the drawing I used rather than any limitation on my part or the software's At one time I could knock of a diesel or steam loco in about 10 days but as you add additional detail the modeling time increases as does the time taken to get the thing to load.
Enjoy
