BR Green 57XX Panniers Multipack
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A set of pannier tanks in BR Green livery, all allocated to Croes Newydd Shed, Wrexham.  Made especially for the Bala Hub route by Gordon McKenzie.  These locos are perfect for working the Blaenaeu Ffestiniog Branch, Ruabon-Bala locals and shunting and short haul freights around the industrial areas of Ruabon.

Thanks to Reg for allowing thse reskins, and Richard Gibb for making a new eng file for it.  Be-aware the brakes are more realistic than most GWR train sim locos, to release hem you need to open the ejector (j key)

To install, just run the self install programme.

To use this loco, Stuart Williamson's GWR soundset must be installed, which is available on UKTS, file id: 6481.

Locos with a # prefix are computer controlled and used in traffic consists.

Then create a consists and away you go!

The shape file of the prarie tank is the property of Reg Furniss, the original author and may be reskinned with his permission.  The textures are the property of David Ward and may be applied to other models with his permission.
