This model is for your personal use only, and may not be sold or distributed in any way without the author's permission.

The prototype
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These containers were built to carry fresh meat and other frozen or perishable traffic.
The Birds eye containers were very restricted in the route they took but that never stopped me from modelling and running them.

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

Unzip the file to a temporary folder.
Copy or move the folder BR_Insulated_Container into the \TRAINS\TRAINSET directory.
( Normally - Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\TRAINS\TRAINSET

You are now ready to create consists containing this model by using the Activity Editor
supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator - the model will not be available in the simulator unless you do this.

The container is set up as an animated load, so it does not show in the Consist Editor, but the container will appear in the Sim........honest, yes it will, it will, it will............... 

Please be aware that this model may or may not be compatible with all the engines and rolling stock that you have available. 

This wagon is currently set up for Automatic coupling.

This container can be set up as scenery items if you really must fill your goods yards up with static items, Ian explains how in his original readme.......!!

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.

THANKS

Big Thanks again go to Ian Morgan for allowing his models to be altered.
