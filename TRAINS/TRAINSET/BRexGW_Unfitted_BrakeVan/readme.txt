DEPOTS.

The GWR allocated brake vans to particulae depots, usually assosiated with loco sheds.
To keep the balcony to the rear the vans were given diagrams, usually involving triangular routes. Photos of GW freight trains often show a van mid-train in a turning move.
They were also taken to the shed to use the turntable. Vans used on branch lines were allocated to the nearest main yard and were "subsheded" to the branch like the locos.
Because of the open air handbrake GW vans never strayed from the GW. If they did they were quickly returned as SR and LMS men would refuse to use them.

Further depot names to suit most MSTS routes are included in the Depots folder.
To change the depot, delete the Depot1, 2 or 3 .ace, COPY the name ace  you require to the main folder and rename it Depot1, 2 or 3 .ace as required.

Copywrite for this model remains with Paul Gausden. If you wish to repaint the wagon please contact Paul.
If granted you may then use this repaint as a basis without my permission.
Repaints of the depot.ace to represent other depots are welcome provided they are renamed for inclusion in the Depots folder.
