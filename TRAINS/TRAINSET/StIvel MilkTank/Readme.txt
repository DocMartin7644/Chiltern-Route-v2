This model is based on an original by Chris Baily ( Baily9531 ) which is still available from ukts under file id 6157. 'BR(W) grubby Milk Tank'. 
Many thanks to Chris for permission to upload this version.

As with the original, this tank wagon comes in three configurations:- Chain coupling-vacuum braked, Automatic coupling-vacuum braked, and Automatic coupling-air braked.
 
These wagons were used on the heavy milk traffic from Cornwall and Devon to Acton, West Ealing and Kensington in London throughout the 1950s,1960s and 1970s. The main pick up points for milk traffic were St Erth, Dalcoath, Lostwithiel, Saltash, Totnes, Torrington and Hemyock, and there were also many small sidings producing just one or two tanks per day. St Ivel, Unigate, Express, Co-Op and United Dairies were the main consignors of milk by rail although the different liveries once seen on these tanks tended to disappear under a thick coating of dirt, making them all look the same! The wagons racked up such huge weekly mileages that there was rarely much opportunity for external cleaning! The livery for all milk tanks became standardised as silver on a black chassis in the 1950s but many of the old liveries survived well into the 1970s.
The chassis' and running gear belonged to the railway while the tanks themselves belonged to the dairies, and because milk is such a perishable product the tank wagons were built to passenger coaching stock standards to allow for high speed travel to the capital.
The transport of milk by rail in the UK was consigned to history in May 1980 when road transport took over. They call it "progress".
