LNER Thompson Coaches.

In the last year of WW2 design work started on new coaches for the East Coast main line. What emerged were completely different from previous coaches.
The first appeared in 1945. Two versions were built -  coaches for the principal expresses had pressure ventilation and the body sides extended down over the frames.
The earliest coaches were put into service in East coast sets but, as most of the teak restuarant cars and firsts had been stored during the war, complete sets were not built.
General service stock followed in 1948. Construction ending in 1950.
BR mark 1coaches had displaced the express set vehicles by the early 60s and the last built coaches had been withdrawn by 1968.
The BGs lasted longer in parcels service and most recieved rail blue livery.

The coaches were painted in the fake teak livery used on the Gresley steel stock but, as the raised beading was not painted on, the result was unconvincing.
Most coaches recieved BR blood and custard in the mid 50s.
But some of the later built coaches went direct from teak to 1957 maroon livery.
