HISTORY
~~~~~~~
This 42T capacity Bogie Bolster is one of a batch built by BR between 1951 and the late 1960's, and is used to carry lengthy, heavy loads.  Many examples of this type survive in departmental use.  This is an early example, with older-style bogies.

This file is a direct replacement for one of my first uploads, and the naming convention remains the same for the benefit of activity makers.  This wagon may also be used to replace one of those removed by Terry Thornton - BogieBolsterWagon_01.  I have included a separate ZIP file containing wag files for those who wish to do this.

The original package included two load varieties as freightanims.  The loads are two biggish girders, and a bunch of red tubes - this package contains three extra loads, strip coils, a finned object and smallish girders, as well as three varieties of empty wagon.  The loads will not show up in the consist editor - so you need to look for the names ending in Dloadx - where "x" represents the load number.

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unzip all the files into the folowing place Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\trains\trainset. Winzip should create a folder called BR_Bolster_D

If you want to replace Terry's wagons, you will need to copy all the files from this zip file except the WAG files. into the directory BogieBolsterWagon_01.  You will then need to copy the wag files from TT_Bolsters.zip into the directory BogieBolsterWagon_01. 

You will need to add the wagon to a consist before it will become available for use.

Instructions on how to use the MSTS Activity Editor may be found in tutorials at UK Trainsim.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.
