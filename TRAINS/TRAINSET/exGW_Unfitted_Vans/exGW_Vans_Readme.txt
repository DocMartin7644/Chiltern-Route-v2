PROTOTYPE
~~~~~~~~~~
The GWR built few vans in the early days, most loads were carried in sheeted opens.
In 1886 the first of the famous iron minks appeared. Construction continued until 1902 when diagram V5 was introduced.
This was basically a wooden version of the iron mink, It had horizontal planks, Steel bracing with X shaped end reinforcing and a wooden door frame. length was 16ft.
V4 followed in 1905 and was similar but higher and wider. Most were vacuum braked and could carry 10T.
V12 emerged in 1907 and this fixed the hight at almost 12feet and 8feet wide over side sheeting which remained the standard size for all subsequent vans. Slatted vents were given to the ends.
V14, built from 1912 had bonnet vents and later builds had self contained buffers.
V16, also built from 1912 was outwardly similar and both were built concurrently until 1923 with the last V14 emerging in 1927.
V18 built from 1923 had Morton brakes but was othwise similar.

In 1927 the RCH 17ft6in underframe was adopted and the body was streached to fit with a new, wider door.
The first batch to V21(vacuum) and V33 (unfitted) were 9ft wheelbase.
from 1933, V23 extended the wheelbase to 10foot and has straight down side stanchions.
Also from 1933 was V26 with internal partitions to prevent shifting loads.
V34 was a wartime version which used underframe variations to reduce materials. They were unfitted.
Finally in 1944, plywood replaced planks. V36 were vacuum braked and V37 unfitted.

In the mid 50s BR converted most of the unfitted 10ft wheelbase wagons to vacuum brake.
The earlier 9ft WB wagons were withdrawn by the mid 50s but many passed to non revenue service, mainly as stores vans.
The Later vacuum braked wagons lasted until the 70s.
