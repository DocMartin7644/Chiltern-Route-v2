Thankyou for downloading this sound configuration.

IMPORTANT
~~~~~~~~~
This alternative sound set is more complex than the MSTS original. Hence only one Scalability Level has been implimented rather than the three levels used by MS/Kuju.

ONLY INSTALL IF YOUR SOUND OPTION LEVEL IS SET TO HIGH AND MSTS PERFORMS TO YOUR SATISFACTION. REVERT TO YOUR ORIGINAL Fscoteng.sms FILE IF PERFORMANCE SEEMS IMPAIRED.

ZIPPED FILES
~~~~~~~~~~~~
15 mono wav files
fscoteng.sms
readme.txt

These sound are timed for use with the Flying Scotsman model in MSTS.
They are for your personal use only, and may not be sold or distributed in any way.

HISTORY
~~~~~~~
The original sounds of the Flying Scotsman leave a lot to be desired. Others have posted simple improvements (ie use of variable1 instead of speed) on various TS forums. Murray Curtis has released a set of 'timed' sounds including further .wav's for highier speeds.

This configuration brings together these and also adds more effects.

However, it appears (in the abscense of any documentation from MS/Kuju) that the sms system used in MSTS is not adequate for really authentic sound reproduction of steam locomotives. Thus compromises have had to be made, some effects do not seem possible, and some changes result in unwanted side effects.

But the overall result is an improvement.

NOTE: This version changes EXTERNAL SOUNDS ONLY.

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing these sounds, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

Step 1. Extract the contents of this zip file into the \Trainset\Scotsman folder, overwriting the existing fscoteng.sms file.

Note: only the fscoteng.sms file should overwrite an existing. Ensure a backup copy of this file is made before installation. All the .wav files are additional (unless you already have Murray Curtis's .wav files)


WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.

CHANGES MADE
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gains:-
- Correct 3 cylinder (6 beat) rythum.
- Better beats per wheel revolution syncronisation.
- Wheel slip simulated.
- Beat volume proportional to regulator application (ie cruising in silence occurs)
- Speed proportional rail/joint sound effect added.
- AI Loco (traffic) generic sounds replaced by same sounds as driveable loco. 
- .wav files are fully aliased enabling this file to be used in other \sound folders.

Losses/side effects:-
- Fade in/fade out between .wav files lost.
- Volume jumps at about 50% regulator.
- Volume also varies (oddly!) with reverser level.

The best way to experience all the new effects is to do an FScot run as follows:-
- Start stationary. Change to 'head out of cab' view.
- Press and hold D. Wheels will slip giving a sudden high wheel speed sound.
- Press and hold A till wheelslip stops. Accelarate slowly away, Beats speed increases to a pur.
- At speed shut off the regulator. Beat volume decreases to silence leaving a track rythum.
- Slowly apply the breaks. Track rythum slows with speed.

FURTHER WORK
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Similar changes for Cab views.
- More muffled Cab beats sound.
- Similar mods for the RoyalScot and Pendennis (with correct beats and sync relative to number of cylinders and wheel diameter).
