This model is for your personal use only, and may not be sold or distributed in any way without the author's permission.

NOTES
~~~~~
Wagon No.2, more to follow ;)
This model does not incorporate any Level Of Detail (LOD) - performance may suffer ( high polygons=low fps )
Once this problem is solved an updated version will be available.

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

Copy or move the folder BRMINERAL01 into the \TRAINS\TRAINSET directory.
( Normally - Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\TRAINS\TRAINSET

You are now ready to create a consist containing this model by using the Activity Editor
supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator - the model will not be available in the simulator unless you do this.

Please be aware that this model may or may not be compatible with all the engines and rolling stock that you 
have available.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.

THANKS
~~~~~~

SUPPORT
~~~~~~~
I intend to produce more BR stock of this era ( BR Blue 70's - 80's ) , if you have any requests or for that matter
any decent photos ( preferably side/end views ) then mail me I'll see what I can do.
The original bitmaps may be made available for re-skinning at a later date.
Hopefully coaching stock and loco's will folow.

     Thanks
