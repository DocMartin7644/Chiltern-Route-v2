PROTOTYPE.
~~~~~~~~~~
The Railway Clearing House set specifications for wagon design to allow ease of repair and common sizes and clearances.
The 1907 standard was for a wagon 16ft long and 7ft  10" wide.
10s of thousands of wagons were built to this design for the coal and mineral trade.
A fixed end and an end door version of the model are included along with various loads.

If you have the previous version of this wagon please delete it first.
Loading over the top of the previous version will do no harm but will leave some unneeded files.

This will install the wagon folder and it's Common.Loads folder to your Trainset folder.
