Bullied West Country Cabview Version 1

A Bullied West Country cabview which can be used to relace what ever cabview you are using. Left hand drive. As I live abroad, I have limited reference material and so some of the controls/positions are not necessarily correct against the prototype. Apologies to the purists.

To install the cab: Unzip the file (I usualy set the download location as the desktop). 

Open the downloaded folder and copy and paste the cabview folder into the loco of your choice. This will over-write the old cabview.

NOTE: If you want to keep the original cabview, rename the folder cabvieworiginal or similar before copying the new cabview.
 

Open the eng file with wordpad or similar.
 
Find the CABVIEW entry. Change this to BulliedWC.

If you have a crew installed as a freight animation in the eng file, this line may need to be removed as it may conflict with the cabview.





Anyone is welcome to use/modify the cab or parts without asking my permission but I would appreciate if  this original read me is included.
