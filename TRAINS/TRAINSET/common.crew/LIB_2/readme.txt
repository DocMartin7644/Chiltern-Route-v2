Library of Crew Animations Based on BlueArrow's Crew Shapes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Burton Derby CD Version


Severn Valley Railway route installation is no longer required thanks to Terry Thornton (Duckweed).  The diesel locos crews are now in a separate download.  It is not necessary to update Version 2 if you already have this installed (although Version 3 does have a new driver texture).  Standard 5 crew is added.

The crew textures are produced by Terry Thornton (Duckweed) and are used with his permission.


"Crew Aliases 2" (available from UKTS - File ID# 7706) must be installed for these Crew Animations to be used.


This package uses aliasing and a common.crew folder for the crew animation files (similar to the common.cab and common.sound folders).  By doing this animations can be easily added to any locomotive by the addition of only one line to the .eng file.  No files need to be added to the locomotive folder.
