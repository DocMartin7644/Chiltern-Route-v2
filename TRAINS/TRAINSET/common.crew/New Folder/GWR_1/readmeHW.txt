Paul Gausden's GWR and Other Crew Animations Adjusted For Simple Addition to Any Steam Locomotive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Highworth Version

See the extracts for Paul Gausden's original readme files, at the end of this file, for derails of his original release of these crew shapes.  This package is prepared with his permission.


This package uses aliasing and a common.crew folder for the crew animation files (similar to the common.cab and common.sound folders).  By doing this animations can be easily added to any locomotive by the addition of only one line to the .eng file.  No files need to be added to the locomotive folder.



Based on the following
