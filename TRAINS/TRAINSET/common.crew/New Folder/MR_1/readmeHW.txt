MR (S&C 1920) Crew Animations Adjusted For Simple Addition of Crew to Other Steam Locomotives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Highworth Version


This package uses aliasing and a common.crew folder for the crew animation files (similar to the common.cab and common.sound folders).  By doing this animations can be easily added to any locomotive by the addition of only one line to the .eng file.  No files need to be added to the locomotive folder.

The crew animations are those produced by Brian Bere-Streeter in his "Skipton Loco Crews" package and are unchanged.  Original Loco Crew files by Paul Gausden (Decapod).  "Crew Aliases 1" (available from UKTS) must be installed for these Crew Animations to be used.
