Library of Crew Animations Based on Paul Gausden's Crew Shapes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Highworth Version


See the extracts for Paul Gausden's original readme files, at the end of the "Crew Aliases 1" readme file, for details of his original release of these crew shapes.  These shapes are used with his permission.


This is the first version of a "library" of crew animations using crew figures akready available for download.  This package uses aliasing and a common.crew folder for the crew animation files (similar to the common.cab and common.sound folders).  By doing this animations can be easily added to any locomotive by the addition of only one line to the .eng file.  No files need to be added to the locomotive folder.
