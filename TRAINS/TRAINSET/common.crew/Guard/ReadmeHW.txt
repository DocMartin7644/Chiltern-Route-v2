Uniformed Brake Vans Guards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Highworth Version

Figures by Paul Gausden (decapod)
Passenger views by Bob Latimer (latimers)
Shape file adjustment by David Forrest (dforrest)



This package uses aliasing and a common.crew folder for the crew animation files (similar to the common.cab and common.sound folders).  By doing this "animations" can be easily added to any locomotive or wagon by the addition of only one line to the .wag (or .eng) file.  No files need to be added to the wagon or locomotive folder.

"Inside" statements are also given which will cause the Passenger (Key 5) to be view synchronised with the position of the guard in the Break Van.  You see what he sees!  This is based on a idea of latimers Jr.
