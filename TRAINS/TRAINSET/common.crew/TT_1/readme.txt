Terry Thornton's Crew Animations Adjusted For Simple Addition of Crew to Other Steam Locomotives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Burton Derby CD Version


This package uses aliasing and a common.crew folder for the crew animation files (similar to the common.cab and common.sound folders).  By doing this animations can be easily added to any locomotive by the addition of only one line to the .eng file.  No files need to be added to the locomotive folder.

The crew animations are those produced by Terry Thornton (Duckweed) and are used with his permission..
