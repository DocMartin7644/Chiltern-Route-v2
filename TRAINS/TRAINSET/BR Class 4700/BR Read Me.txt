Version 1.2
One of the perils of using Train Store is that .eng files go missing from the MSTS installation.
ALL of the .eng files are now included.
With regard to the issue of Black locos below, it would seem that the perceived opinion is that they would have initially been sent out in Black and were painted green later on. This would suggest that the Early tender would be appropriate. 

Version 1.1
The tenders now appear in Conbuilder Lite. No idea what was wrong!!

This pack represents the entire class of the BR 4700 locos in Black or Green with early and late tenders. It's unclear as to whether the locos were ever painted in black as all the photos that were foind appeared to be green. If you're unhappy about it ignore the black ones!! There are three black and six green. 

The numbers and allocations are as follows :-

BR Black

4701	81A
4704	81A
4707	81C

BR Green

4700	81A
4702	81A
4703	82B
4705	81A
4706	82B
4708	81A

The 2 cylinder sound set is required (File ID: 2910 and 2919) and the crew aliases (File ID: 7706).
