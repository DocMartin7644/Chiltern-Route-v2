MODERN DIESEL HYDRAULIC UNIT SOUNDS

**********************************************************************************************
YOU USE THESE SOUNDS AT YOUR OWN RISK.  PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR SYSTEM CAN USE COMPLICATED SOUND FILES AND THAT YOU BACK UP ANYTHING BEFORE MODIFYING THE FILES.  THEY HAVE BEEN TESTED BY OTHERS AND HAVE WORKED ON A VARIETY OF MACHINES, BUT I WILL NOT GIVE ANY WARRANTIES OR UNDERTAKINGS THAT THEY WILL WORK ON YOUR SET UP.  

THESE FILES ARE FREEWARE.  HOWEVER THEY MUST NOT BE REDISTRIBUTED IN ANY FORM FOR MONEY (THEY CONTAIN DEFAULT SOUNDS WHICH MICROSOFT'S END USER LICENCE PROHIBITS THE USE OF FOR COMMERCIAL GAIN, AND DON'T FORGET THEIR LAWYERS ARE A BIT MORE STRICT THAN ME).  IF YOU WISH TO USE THE FILES IN A MODEL THEN PLEASE DROP ME A MAIL ON wombatofludham@yahoo.co.uk TO DISCUSS FIRST, AND INCLUDE THIS README IN THE FILE.

SORRY TO SHOUT BUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T READ READMES AND DO STUFF THEY SHOULDN'T IS A BIT OF A PAIN IN THE £$+!.....

README

This file contains all you need to apply the modern second-generation Sprinter sounds to your chosen MSTS Model. They have been optomised for a Class 170, but will probably be fine to use in 175 and 180 class units, and earlier Networker Turbo sets.  It uses a high revving, silenced engine note, which "changes gear" at about 30 mph where the direct-drive kicks in, so it can be used for any hydro-mechanical unit with a similar automatic gear change.

Installation.

You must first unzip the files into a temporary folder.  Then drag and drop the files into your chosen train set, replacing the existing "sound" folder.

The file contains three sms files.  The cab and eng files are named for Jonathan Powell's Class 170 and should work just as they are.  However, the third sms is for the second/third car, and avoids the running on idle effect trailer/helper cars have in MSTS.  To use this file in your intermediate and rear coaches you will need to edit the centre and rear eng files (or the wag file in any other unit where the coaches are classed as trailers) so that the sound file refers to "170engrev.sms" instead of 170eng.sms.  This is simpler than it sounds, just copy and paste the name into the "sound" line which is usually just after the long section describing the lights.

If you decide to use these files in any other unit the easiest way to get them to work is to change the "sound" line in each eng/wag file to refer to "170cab.sms", "170eng.sms" or "170engrev.sms" as appropriate.

Issues

You must have the KIHA unit installed as the sound script aliases to the KIHA for the brake, compressor and control sounds.  Aliasing saves disc space and avoids having a big file to download.

The sounds included in the file are all original.  The mix and scripting is very complex and you must be certain your sound card and MSTS set up can handle complex sound files.  It will help if you modify the sound config file in the Global folder to increase the number of sounds that can be played at once (go to http://forums.uktrainsim.com/viewtopic.php?t=8717 for Stuart Williamson's explanation of how to do this). 

The driving car has got a throttle related script which means that when you drop your controller from full power to idle, the engine will drop to idle as well.  However, the MSTS sound system doesn't allow for any second or more powered vehicles in a consist to have throttle control, and so the engine note on these vehicles is speed controlled.  This means that their engines will only change as speed changes, and you can have the situation where the lead car is on idle but the next car is still revving away.  There is nothing that can be done about this, but I felt it better to have the car powered than permanently on idle which is the MSTS default.

The rail sound in the background is continuous welded rail.  Again the MSTS sound set up means the rail noise is assigned to the coaches, and therefore can only be jointed OR cwr but cannot change depending on route.  To do a jointed track sound would have made the sound file too complex to work, so you are stuck with a continuous welded sound, plus it was the only sound I had in my own archive without using other people's work!

The horn is the default class 50 horn.  Not quite correct, but it does have a very clever little trick which allows you to hold the low note for a long time if you wish.

That's it.  If you've got this far then you deserve a round of applause as most 'erberts don't even read these things!

Enjoy,
