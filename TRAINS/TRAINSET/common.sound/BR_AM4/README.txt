To Load.

Just click on the self installer.  Or, if you are a computer nerd and don't like self installers, change the directory so it self installs somewhere else for you to manually install in the Train Simulator folder.  However, given the majority like self installers, that's what we've done.

Any problems go to the UK Train Sim site (http://www.uktrainsim.com) forums and post a message asking for help.  Politely or we will ignore you.
