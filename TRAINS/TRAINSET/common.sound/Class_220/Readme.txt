Welcome!
Thankyou for downloading the reworked class 221/220 voyager sounds. To install, simply follow the instructions below, you'll be pretty happy with the results! 

CREDITS------------------------------------------------------------
*Mixing of sounds - (C) Sam Kelly
*All Voyager sounds - (C) John Owen (thanx!)
*Base HST engine - (C)Ben Hyde - (no email found - what a perfect engine, this man is incredible :-)

*Quick note - These sounds are general modern DMU sounds and, although taken from a class 221 voyager unit, can still be used on the class 180 and other classes of high speed dmu.

INSTALLATION ---------------------------------------

1) - located in the ZIP folder, there is a file named 'common.sound'. This is the folder containing the sound information. Extract this file to your TRAINSET file located in you train simulator directory. (eg - C:/program files/microsoft games/train simulator/trains/TRAINSET )

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
?) If you already have the file common.sound, open the folder and take the file 'voyager'  and place it in the TRAINSET/common.sound file already present.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) - Now the file is locked and loaded and ready for use. 

*** I have provided the correct eng files in seperate folders for the default unit, the class 221 and the class 180. The files are located in the 'install my Voyager sounds' file. . ***

(The titles of the files state the units name!)


3 -OTHER TRAINS-------------------------------------------

you don't just have to install the 221 sounds on the voyagers, you can use a variety of stock, the choice is yours.  Lets say you want to install the sounds onto the KIHA31 dmu in msts.

1 - Open the folder containing the stock you wish to convert to voyager sounds. (eg 
“C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\TRAINS\TRAINSET\KIHA31”

2 -Search or a file called kiha31.eng.
3 - make a backup copy of this, call it kiha31old.eng
4 - Scroll down through the code in this file until you find a line that looks something like this: 
	
Sound ( "K31Eng.sms" )

5 - Replace it with - 

( "..\\..\\common.sound\\voyager\\d9eng.sms" )

6 - continue on down until you're nearly at the bottom of the file , you should see a line of text that looks like - 

Sound ( "K31cab.sms" )

replace it with this - 

( "..\\..\\common.sound\\voyager\\d9cab.sms" )

7 - Now you've edited the file, click save and there you go! Simple as that! Now you've converted the kiha to sound like a voyager unit. Feel free to use these sounds as you like!

(If you're using powered cars, only install the sounds to 2 cars! This is important! 
The other cars can use the default coach sounds - 
Sound (	"GenPassWagSteam.sms" )
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Be warned, if you have a dmu which is made up of POWERED coaches, make sure you only install the sounds to the front and rear or front and front in some cases. The reason? quality. You won't be able to hear the awesome turbo of the voyager and the sound will become distorted. 
With this in mind, have fun and remember to back your files up before twiddling things!

DISCLAIMER
you use this file at your own risk, I have tested this file on my PC and it works fine but I take no responsibility for loss of data / disruption to MSTS which may occur on installation
