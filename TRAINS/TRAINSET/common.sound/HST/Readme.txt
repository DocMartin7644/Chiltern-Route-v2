Thank you for downloading this file.

This is the best I can do at the moment but personally I think it sounds a bit more realistic
than the current ones. Anyone is welcome to play around with them and upload a new and improved version of them.

1. Make a back up of your old HST sounds that are located in the common.sound folder in the TRAINSET folder.
These are the sounds you get when you download The original HST sounds.
2. Now copy and paste all the files (the wav files, sms etc.) which are included in this zip file into the HST folder
which is located in the common.sound folder.
3. Now try them out and see if they are any better. If not, just copy and paste the files
from your back up folder into the HST folder where you had previously put my sounds.

Hope you like them.

Any problems just pm me on forums. My username is phat2003uk

Feedback to richa2002@hotmail.com please!

Version 2.0 has re-worked sounds with new recordings that are more realistic and I have a attempted to eradicate the
looping sound
