         Class 73 Electric Sound Package for Microsoft Train Simulator


This is my sound package for the Class 73 on Electric Power for use in MSTS.

This Sound Package is for use with the Class 73's on Electric Power that are about to start being released on UKTrainsim
I have used the same aliasing routine that Dave Roles used for the CIG'S, and I used recently for the 08 Sounds and Class 73 Diesel Sounds.
This package sits in the comman.sound folder in Trainset/MSTS, and then all the other Class 73's on Electric you download will
use this folder for their sounds hence saving HD space.
All Sound Samples are recorded from an actual Class 73 Loco in and around Victoria/Gatwick Airport on 29/04/02

Now these Loco's are on Electric Power you should see a marked improvement in performance as opposed to when running on their Diesel Engine.

 

INSTALLATION:
 
Copy the contents of the comman.sound zip to the comman.sound folder in MSTS Trainset folder.
You should then be able to enjoy the new sounds.


THANKS:

Thanks to Dave Roles for the Electric.eng file modification
          Kim Durose for the Engine Lighting part of the .eng file
          Mark Shipman for is excellant photos which have helped in repainting these Loco's
