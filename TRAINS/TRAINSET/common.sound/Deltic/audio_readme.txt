MSTS DELTIC SOUND EFFECTS (aka "72 pistons doing the Deltic dance")
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Congratulations - you are now the proud owner of a set of 100% authentic sound files to go with 
Mark Shipman's most excellent MSTS Deltics.

However, before you get too excited, please be advised they are not as good as I'd like them to 
be. Getting them to loop properly is well nigh impossible, plus there's a bit of wind noise on a 
couple of the external sounds. After lots of tweaking I've got them as good as they're going to 
get, but they're a lot more realistic than a Dash 9 or a Class 37! I think a special MSTS 
recording run is called for ;-)

On top of that, the .sms file does weird things to the .wav files. However, I've managed to 
adjust the external .sms file to improve the sound slightly by minimising the cross-fade effect 
(see Revision History below).

On the plus side, these files were produced from recordings (video camera hi-fi sound track) of 
D9019 'Royal Highland Fusilier' hard at work with both engines running on the East Lancashire 
Railway in November 1998, both external (from the first coach) and in-cab. Therefore 100% real. 
You might think the in-cab sounds are a bit of a din, well that's exactly what your poor eardrums 
have to put up with in one of these things...

Anyway, to use the files you don't need to do anything, as Mark's clever installation program has 
done it all for you. Note that the authentic Deltic mating call has also been included, which can 
be experienced by pressing the 'horn' button.

Unfortunately some of the best Deltic sound effects occur as the engine(s) change speed (up and 
down), which can't be reproduced in MSTS...

BONUS TRACKS!  DELTIC ENGINE START-UP & SHUT-DOWN SOUNDS (aka "Gentlemen... start your engines!")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, you can't do this in MSTS (yet...), but someday we'll be able to "push that button", so 
here's some files for that eventuality (they're also good for annoying the neighbours):

start1.wav  recorded near the cab end of the loco (phasing gear clatter dominant)
start2.wav  recorded near the centre of the loco (air intake sound dominant)
stop.wav    recorded same place as start1.wav

(If you're wondering what "phasing gears" are, they connect the three crankshafts to the main 
generator)

All recordings were of 55019 'Royal Highland Fusilier' starting and stopping its No.2 engine on 
the Nene Valley Railway in July 2001.

REVISION HISTORY
----------------

Version 2 - 28/01/02
--------------------
*  External .sms file (deltic_eng.sms) changed from the original Dash 9 configuration to minimise 
the cross-fade effect and adjust the sound file change-overs with respect to throttle position.
 
*  External sound file x_d9_power_cruise3.wav edited to remove a 'clunk' noise that was really 
annoying me.

Version 1 - 29/08/01
--------------------
*  Sound files thrown together from a couple of handy video recordings I prepared earlier.

OTHER STUFF
-----------

1. You can do anything you want with these sound files, so long as you include this readme file.
2. As of 28/1/02 these sound files have been downloaded about 4000 times between the Train-sim, 
trainsimfiles and UKTrainsim sites. Thanks to everyone who's taken the trouble to download them!
3. If you've never heard a real Deltic in action, I recommend you do so sometime - the real ones 
sound far, far better than the simulation!
4. I hope you enjoy these sound effects, and also welcome any suggestions for improvements.
