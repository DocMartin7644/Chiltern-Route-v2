Comments :
               I would like to thank Gary Cox for this sound package, it 
               makes all the difference to the model, I know it was the 
               hardest challenge yet for Gary, but he has not let us down
               Thanks again Gary for your hard work. 

Installation :

               Quite simply a self installer, you must however also download
               the cab and the Class 421 package and install them.
