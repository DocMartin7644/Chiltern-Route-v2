The contents of this zip file are the copyright of Paul Mitchell February 2008.
You may use the contents for non commercial use. If you want to re-skin go right ahead.

Unzip the contents of the zip file into the trains folder the default path of which is c:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\Trains\Trainset. If using win zip or similar providing you have 'use folder names' ticked the contents should end up in a Sub folder called BR_CLASS4_2-6-4T_80022. If you use the built in compression in Windows XP just open up the zip file and drag the folder into c:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\Trains\Trainset. Now create a consist, I use ConBuilder, you should be up and running. The model uses default cab and sounds for the Scotsman so that needs to be installed.

Be warned the model has a high poly count. 


The model was made with TSM and corrected with polymaster and Decapods MSTS Shape Fixer.

Thanks to Jon Bilton for testing.

Hope you enjoy it
