This  model is of an English Electric diesel electic locomotive BR Class 08. 
Based on engine D3508 in BR green livery and with front ladder fitted.
The actual loco is preserved at the Dean Forest Railway.

Note......
The model has the later BR crest, if you would like to use the early crest then
copy and past the " symbols.ace " file from the separate " early crest " folder
into the main RF_D3508 folder, allow it to overwrite the original.
REMEMBER FIRST TO KEEP A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL " symbols.ace " FILE.
 
You will need Kieron Dougherty`s " Class 20 sound set " UKTS File ID12358
