Standard 4 sound set for the SVR Std4.

This is a set of sounds for the SVR Std4 compiled and edited by Andy Hardy. To use these sounds you will need to backup your BA_Standard4 sound set found in BA_Common_Sounds.

Once backed up copy and paste this file into that folder and overwrite when prompted.
This is Andys first freeware release and he would like some feedback in the forum please.
