DEE_BR_9F_92141    Version 2


Acknowledgements:

Many Thanks to Paul Mitchell for allowing his model to be reskinned.

Note -  The original readme file is also included here.



Version 1 - This was withdrawn as there was no on-screen indication of brake operation.

Version 2 -  The revised .eng file now shows on-screen brake operation.

	     Additionally there is an alternative .eng and .wag file provided. These were kindly forwarded to me whilst I was investigating the Version 1 problem. As well as giving on-screen indication of brake operation,these files also enable air brakes, bin couplers, and different steaming characteristics. 
             It's your choice!
