HISTORY
~~~~~~~
This 4 wheeled petrol tanker is based on the RCH standard tanker which was in common use until replaced by the longer wheelbase TTA tanks in the early 1960's.  The chassis were railway owned, but the tanks were typically owned by an oil company, or a pool of companies, as in this case.

V2.0 drops straight over my embarrassingly old V1.0

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unzip all the files into the folowing place Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\trains\trainset. Winzip should create a folder called Tanker_Shell_BP

You will need to add the wagon to a consist before it will become available for use.

Instructions on how to use the MSTS Activity Editor may be found in tutorials on the Internet.

This vehicle is unfitted and has chain couplings.  To change to automatic (very unprototypical!) you'll need to replace the word "Chain" in the .WAG files, with the word "Automatic".

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.

THANKS
