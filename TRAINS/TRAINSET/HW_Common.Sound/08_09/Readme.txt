         Class 08/09 Sound Package for Microsoft Train Simulator


This my Class 08/09 sound package for use in MSTS.

The Source of the package comes from 086613 Ilford Depot Pilot and was recorded in the early hours of Wednesday Morning April 10th 2002.
This is one of the advantages of working for the Railways being able to get close to these Loco's.
 
When I obtained the sound samples I didn't think they were that good, but after editing them in CoolEdit 2000 the final result was actually quite good.
This package gives the correct feel for these little work horses in MSTS(rather than some American Loco Sound)
 
I have used the same aliasing routine that Dave Roles used for the CIG'S, with the sounds sitting in the comman.sound folder in the Trainset folder of MSTS. and other Loco's of the same type being able to use them to save Hard disk space.
 

INSTALLATION:
 
Copy the contents of the 08_09snd zip to the common.sound folder in MSTS Trainset folder.

 
You should then be able to enjoy the new sounds.
To use the sound package for other Class 08/09 Loco's just copy the sound folder from 08810 to each other Class 08/09 Loco you want to use the sounds for(delete any other sound folder first if one is present)
Next using Wordpad edit the eng.file changing the following entries to read  
Sound ( "gp38eng.sms" )

Sound ( "gp38cab.sms" )

Save the changes you have made and now all your Class 08/09 Loco's should use the new sounds.

I hope you enjoy using these sounds and agree they make the Shunters in MSTS a lot better. Please feel free to send me back any comments or feedback you have on the sound package(good or bad) Then hopefully they will be on general release at the Weekend.
