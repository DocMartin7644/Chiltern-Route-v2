BR exLMS 1 plank Lowfit.

Model    : Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.

1000 of these wagons were built in 1938 to Diagram 1986. The sides were fixed and this prevented them being used for wheeled loads but it also allowed them to carry containers. They were unfitted and had Morton 4 shoe brakes.
BR later fitted them with vacuum brakes.

The fitted model is based on a wagon as running in BR days which has been incorrectly banned from carrying containers. The wagons come with a typical selection of loads.
