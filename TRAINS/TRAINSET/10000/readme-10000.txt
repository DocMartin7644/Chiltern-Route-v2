LMS/BR "prototype" 1,600hp locomotives 10000/10001

History
~~~~~~~

Construction of the two LMS prototypes was carried out at Derby works where the first locomotive carrying the number 10000  
emerged in November 1947.

The prime mover used was an English Electric unit able to develop 1,600hp, power for traction being electric, provided by a  
generator coupled to the diesel engine.

After No 10000 was completed it underwent a considerable testing period at Derby, and by mid January 1948, No 10000 was operating  
various main  line specials.

In February No 10000 was released to general service.

The second of the prototypes, No 10001 was not completed until July 1948.

By September both locomotives were available for operation and commenced driver training on the Euston-Carlisle route, and by October, Euston to Carlisle was a regular duty.

Between 1949 and 1953 the machines were either used singly or in multiple on a variety of St Pancras and Euston line services, visiting Derby at times for inspection and modification.

It must not pass without note that the EE power units used in these prototypes were developed and refined, and the design has  
been used in many production designs of BR locomotive, including the Class 40 and Class 50.

Sadly neither loco have been preserved


THE DOWNLOAD 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This download is ver2.0

It includes locomotive 10000 and 10001, all necessary sound files and cab view files and 3 consists ( 10000LE,10001LE, and 10000LE/10001LE ).

It is fully compatible with MSTS Bin and has a "night" cab.

The models are based on how the engines would look prior to the 9th of March 1951 as this is the date 10000 had the distinct LMS lettering removed.
10001 was not fitted with the LMS lettering at all, as it was completed after nationalisation, and did not have its BR emblems applied until 10th April 1951.


The cab views are my interpretation, given the info I have been able to find, of what the cab may have looked like.

The sounds are also my interpretation of what these magnificent engines may have sounded like.
