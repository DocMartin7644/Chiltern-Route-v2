BR Class 20 with head code disk a version with the later train indicator panel will follow at some point. The main model has about as much detail as I could cram into one 's' file The freight_anim adds 3d cab detail most of buffer beam pipes, roof and some side panels as well as the driver. If you dont like the driver the upload has a driver free version. There are two models with slightly different Green liveries.Theres also eng files for airbraked versions of both models

Unzip the contents of the zip file into the trains folder the default path of which is c:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\Trains\Trainset. If using win zip or similar providing you have 'use folder names' ticked the contents should end up in two Sub folder. If you use the built in compression in Windows XP just open up the zip file and drag the folder into c:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\Trains\Trainset. Now create a consist, I use ConBuilder, you should be up and running. The model uses default cab and sounds for the Scotsman so that needs to be installed.
