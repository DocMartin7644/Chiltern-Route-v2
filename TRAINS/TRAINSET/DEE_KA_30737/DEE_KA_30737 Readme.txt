King Arthur Class N15 4-6-0  30737 "King Uther"


This model requires Kim Durose's Cabfile - KDSchools.cvf. I believe it is still available on Trainsim.com, alternatively it can be found in UKTS File ID 20055 N15X 32329.  It was used with Kim's permission on this model,on condition that it remains freeware and no charge is made - it is essential that everyone observes this condition. 

The crew have been obtained from UKTS ID 7706.

With the exception of the crew, the contents of this file - DEE_KA_30737 - are the copyright of Danny Gilbert. June 2013.


The model has been tested prior to release, but any subsequent download and installation must be undertaken at your own risk. The model is Freeware and for personal use only and all files are for distribution by UKTS only. They must not be made available from any other website - or used in any other way - without my permission.

If you want to re-skin then go right ahead - I look forward to seeing them! The only condition is that a copy of this readme is included in the folder.

THE MODEL

This model is based on my original, but has been modified and updated by John Riddell.

The model represents 30737 in the BR Brunswick Green livery which it carried from June 1951 to June 1956 when it was withdrawn. It was the second of the original group of N15 locomotives built by the London & South Weatern Railway at their Eastleigh Works near Southampton. When the Class was incoporated into the Southern Railway's new build King Arthur Class they became known as "Urie" Arthur's, so called because they had been designed by Robert Urie, the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the LSWR. 

"King Uther" entered traffic in October 1918, and when it was withdrawn it had covered 1,412,683 miles.
