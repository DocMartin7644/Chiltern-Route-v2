INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

Unzip all the files into a folder called unziptemp

Double-click the file BRLoriotInstaller.exe and follow the instructions.
If you have installed MSTS onto a drive other than C: then change the drive specified when given the option.

You are now ready to create a consist containing these models by using the Activity Editor
supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator - the model will not be available in the simulator unless you do this.

Note that there are more than one versions of these wagons supplied, with a vehicle, and empty.
The vehicle is set up as an animated load, so it does not show in the Consist Editor, they both
look empty. Check the names of them.

Please be aware that this model may or may not be compatible with all the engines and rolling stock that you 
have available.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.
