Cabview for Class 20 Diesel locomotive.

The Cabview consists of forward driving position
along with a choice of left, rear and right views.
The rear views have been created for use with either green or blue locos.

Prior to installation, unzip Class20cab.zip to a temporary folder.
This will give you the opportunity to decide whether you would like
to install to loco Cabview or Common.cab installation.
