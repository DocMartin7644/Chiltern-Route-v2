Cab installation:

Unzip Class40-1cab.zip to a temporary folder.
 
This will give you the opportunity to either install directly to the loco cabview folder
or into the common.cab folder.

Before you transfer any files, BACKUP then DELETE the contents of the cabview folder of the
loco you intend to use with this cab.

To install into loco cabview folder, copy all the files into the cabview folder.

To install into the common.cab make a new folder within the common.cab folder named Class40-1

Copy all the ace files to the new Class40-1 folder.

Copy the class40c.cvf file to your loco cabview folder.


Check the Cabview ( xxxxxx.cvf ) parameter in the loco eng file:


Cabview installed: Eng file needs to be:     Cabview ( class40.cvf )

Common.cab installed: Eng file needs to be:  Cabview ( class40c.cvf )
