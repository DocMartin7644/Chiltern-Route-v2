Class 158 Cabview
==================================================================

This cabview has been created specifically for use with my North West Trains 158.

Installation:

Open the file 158cabview.exe and it should install itself.

I have split this download from the NWT158 to speed up the process and also I am intending to release other 158's in different NWT liveries using this common cabview.

By downloading this file you accept that you will not hold me responsible for any damage that this may cause to your train simulator installation or your computer.

Enjoy it!
