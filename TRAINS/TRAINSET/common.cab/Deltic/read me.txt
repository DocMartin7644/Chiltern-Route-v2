Correcetd 'Deltic' Cab View for use with English Electric locomotives,
in particular BR Class 55 'Deltic' locomotives. 

Version 1, 6th Jan. 2002.

As supplied by Kuju the the cover disc of January 2002's issue of PC FORMAT Magazine,
(this is a UK Magazine, for those living in countries other than the UK).

There are everal problems with the basic view, but this version adresses the problem of the 
incorrect control functions. On the prototype, top left is the locomotive brake valve, 
known in the UK as the Straight Air Brake. Below that, bottom left of the train brake, 
the proportional brake valve. Top right is the throttle lever and under that the reverser.

Unfortuantly, as supplied, these control funtions have been allocated to the wrong levers.

This download corrects the funtions as lised above. The loco brake & throttle have not
recieved any other attention than renaming in the .cvf file. For the reverser and the train
brake it has been necessary of alter the order of the animation frames to make the 
levers work correctly.

I am considering a version 2 which will make further ammendments to the cab view, but as
the necesssary skills are being learnt as I go along, this version may be several days
away.

I have tested this version on my machine and it performs without problems. 
If you are to use it with the Kuju designed Class 55, also supplied on the PC FORMAT
disc, and you wish to reatin the original cab view, I recommend that you rename the
original cab view to somthing along the lines of bakCABVIEW.

For reference I enclose the FPS, (frames per second) for the various setting;
My own preference is for the 1024 x 768 x16.

640 x 480 x 16, 26fps
640 x 480 x 32, 24fps
800 x 600 x 16, 21fps
800 x 600 x 32, 17fps
1024 x 768 x 16, 20fps
1024 x 768 x 32. 10fps

If you are to use the cab view with any of Mark Shipman's proposed fleet of Deltics + DP2, 
then you can either follow the above instructions, or if you prefere delete the supplied 
cab view, which I believe is the GP38 view, though Mark has I believe retained the name
deltic.cvf so installing this version should be painless. (Famous last words!!!)

I will finish by thanking, dispite all I have written about them, Kuju for taking the 
'Bull by the horns' and providing us with a long over due British MSTS Cab View. 
Dispite the errors there is great potential for cab views for most of the English Electric
classes of locomotive.
