Cab View for Class 35 'Hymek' locomotives v1.0 by Gary Price and Chris Baily
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This cabview was built specifically for the Class 35 Hymek models put together by Chris Baily. Alan Salmon, Andy Dunett and myself visitied Chris at the East Lancs Railway in Bury for a day and took lots of photos of cabs for this cabview.

The photos were taken inside the cab of the East Lancs Railway Hymek D7076 and therefore complement Chris's models very well. The cab was made on D7000, and I've included an updated eng file for D7000 here that updates the braking system. Dynamic brakes are no more, and the vacuum brake gauges move in a much more realistic manner.

For this cabview I've gone down the "common.cab" aliassing route to save people space, and to ensure that it will be compatible with more than just the one engine.

You will of course need the engines, available from http://www.uktrainsim.com

For best results, use this cabview with D7000 and Chris's fantastic Hymek sound set. You will need to download and install the following to their default locations:

File Name:  d7000.zip
File ID:    5598

and

File Name:  Hymek.zip
File ID:    4794


What is and isn't included
-------------------------

A complete animated cab is included here, with forward, left and right views all from photographs taken inside D7076. The major controls are all animated, that's the reverser, throttle and both loco and train brake systems. The horn lever is also animated. There are also full brake gauges (except air brake)

I have included an alias cvf file for use with other Class 35 Hymek engines. This is in the common.cab\Hymek folder and is called Hymek.cvf.


Installation
------------

1) Before starting, make a backup of your Trains\Trainset directory, just in case it all goes wrong. Chris and I can accept no responsibility for loss or damage to files on your system.

2) Make sure that you've downloaded and installed d7000.zip and Hymek.zip into the default directories.

3) Now just unzip the contents of this zip file into your C: directory assuming you installed MSTS into it's default location. If you installed MSTS in a custom location, then you probably know enough about MSTS to be able to move the common.cab folder and the modified D7000.eng file into your Trains\Trainset folder already (how's that for a cop-out?) ;-).

4) Next copy the alias file (Hymek.cvf) into your engine's cabview folder.

5) Chris's Hymek models all come ready to go with this cabview. But if your Hymek comes up with a different view, or crashes do the following. Using Wordpad or your favourite unicode editor, make sure that the eng file for the aliassed engine is pointing to the right cvf file:

   For all Class 35 Hymeks the cabview entry should read:      CabView ( Hymek.cvf )
   
That's it. Now go and drive the engines... then let us know what you think.


Thank yous
----------

Extra special thanks go to the East Lancs Railway in Bury for allowing us to photograph this cabview. We had a great day at the railway. I'd thoroughly recommend a visit to any and everyone.

Special thanks to Chris who guided us around the railway and kept us safe!

Thanks to Andy Dunnett and Alan Salmon for being sports for the pictures and for helping with the beta testing.

Lastly thanks yet again to Mrs Fodda for putting up with me hogging the main computer for hours at an end and forcing her to "Look at this!" every time a new animation was complete. ;-)


Notes
-----


You install this at your own risk. In fact, why not back up your Train Simulator directory before installing this in case it all goes pear-shaped? Mind you... it worked fine on my system.
