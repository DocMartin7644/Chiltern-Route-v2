Cab View for Falcon/Class 47 locomotives v1.1 by Gary Price and Chris Baily
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.1: ADDED WORKING WHEELSLIP LIGHT
-----------------------------------

This cabview was built specifically for the lovely Falcon models put together by Chris Baily, John Dibben, Dale Stewart and Andy Dunnett. Chris took a load of pictures of the cab of 47402 which is at present based at the East Lancs Railway based in Bury. What's more amazing is that he used a 35mm camera and scanned the resulting pictures into his computer to send it all to me. The whole lot came out really well.

For this cabview I've gone down the "common.cab" aliassing route to save people space, and to ensure that it's compatible with more than just the one engine. It's simplicity itself to install this cab and use it with all manner of other engines.

You will of course need the engines, available from http://www.uktrainsim.com

As this is being uploaded at the same time as the engines search for Falcon 1200, and both versions of 0280.


What is and isn't included
-------------------------

A complete animated cab is included here, with forward, left and right views all from photographs taken inside 47402. The major controls are all animated, that's the reverser, throttle, loco and both loco and train brake systems. The horn lever is also animated, as are the light and wiper switches although I've taken a bit of a liberty and used untypical positions with these.

There are also photographic left and right views within the cab.

I have included alias cvf files for both the Falcon engines and other Class 47 engines. These are in the common.cab\Falcon-Class47\Alias Files folder.


Installation
------------

1) Before starting, make a backup of your Trains\Trainset directory, just in case it all goes wrong. Chris and I can accept no responsibility for loss or damage to files on your system.

2) Now just unzip the contents of this zip file into your C: directory assuming you installed MSTS into it's default location. If you installed MSTS in a custom location, then you probably know enough about MSTS to be able to move the common.cab folder into you Trains\Trainset folder already (how's that for a cop-out?) ;-).

3) Next copy the required alias file (Falcon.cvf for Falcon models, class47.cvf for 47 locos) into your engine's cabview folder.

4) Finally make sure that the eng file for the aliassed engine is pointing to the right cvf file:

   For Falcon the cabview entry should read            CabView ( Falcon.cvf )
   For Class 47 locos the cabview entry should read    CabView ( class47.cvf )

That's it. Now go and drive the engines... then let us know what you think.


Thank yous
----------

Special thanks to Chris who had to get into the engine and photograph all the controls in such a way that I had enough material to work with. He also somehow managed to drive to and from Bury, take all the pics, get them developed and sent to me all in one day. What a hero. Another lot of beers for him then.

Extra thanks to all those who teamed together to make Falcon for the MSTS community. A right bunch of stars each and every one of them.

Lastly thanks yet again to Mrs Fodda for putting up with me hogging the main computer for hours at an end and forcing her to "Look at this!" every time a new animation was complete. ;-)


Notes
-----


You install this at your own risk. In fact, why not back up your Train Simulator directory before installing this in case it all goes pear-shaped? Mind you... it worked fine on my system.
