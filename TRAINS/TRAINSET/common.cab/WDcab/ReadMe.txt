The original War Department locomotives were dual braked - fitted with both the automatic vacuum brake and Westinghouse brake.

Three alternative cab views are provided for War Department locomotives.

For air braked trains:

CabView ( "..\\..\\common.cab\\WDcab\\WDcabWDA.cvf" )

For vacuum braked trains:

CabView ( "..\\..\\common.cab\\WDcab\\WDcabWDV.cvf" )

For unfitted freight trains, an alternative cab view using the steam brake only is:

CabView ( "..\\..\\common.cab\\WDcab\\WDcabWDX.cvf" )  *** Note - to use this file the eng file must be set up as vacuum braked ***



Locomotives used in Britain, when taken over by British Railways had the air brake equipment removed and the double ended regulator replaced with a single ended version.

To add the British (vacuum braked) cab to an eng file use:

For unfitted freight trains, an alternative cab view using the steam brake only is:

CabView ( "..\\..\\common.cab\\WDcab\\WDcabUKX.cvf" )

A number of WD 2-8-0 and 2-10-0 locomotives were operated in the Netherlands during the late 1940s and early 1950s. These had the vacuum brake equipment removed. 
Locos that did not originally have steam heating were fitted with steam heating, had heating equipment added.
