Class 319 cabview V1.0
By Ben Laws

This release fixes the missing cabview folder

Installation VERY IMPORTANT:

In the trains/trainset/common.cab/Class319cab folder you will find a replacement
cabview folder (remember, not the Class321cab folder). 

Copy this folder and paste it over the cabview folder
located in your chosen class 319 folder eg. trains/trainset/NSECl319.

This will replace the .cvf file and add two front textures (the control textures etc. are
in the common.cab/class321cab folder).

repeat the second step to add cabviews to all of your class 319s. If you find that
one of the trains still have the series 2000 cab, this may be due to the renaming
of the .cvf file. You will need to delete this .cvf file and replace it with the 
NSECl319.cvf, renaming it to the old one (or changing the name in the .eng file)

Additional Information:

The reason I have added a class321cab folder is because the class 321 cabview contains the some of the same graphics as the 319. Note it only contains SOME of the class 321 files so if you want the 321 cab you will need to download it.

Problems:

There shouldn't be any problems. If there are problems, contact me at:
    steelixben@yahoo.co.uk     and I will release a patch or something.
