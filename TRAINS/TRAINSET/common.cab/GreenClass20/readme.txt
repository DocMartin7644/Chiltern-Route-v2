Cabview for the green class 20.

These files add a nose first forward view to the class 20 cabview by Robert potts. They also replace the right hand view with a view looking out of the rear window, Use it when running in reverse or shunting. On the real thing all you would see looking right is the door so your not missing anything.

You must first downloaded the original Class20 cabview files or have installed them into a loco. You can get them from http://UKTrainSim.com File ID

This version uses aliasing to the common.cab folder. This will save you disk space. Why have the same files in each loco when you only need one set?

INSTALLATION
------------

Open the Trainset/Common.cab/GreenClass20 folder.
You will find 3 files and two folders.

In a seperate window, open the class20 CABVIEW folder you have downloaded or one already installed in a loco.

Drag or cut and paste all the files in the cabview folder across to the GreenClass20 folder.

Delete the class20.cvf file and any other .cvf you find.

Open your loco's .eng file and search for the line 

CABVIEW ( xxxxx.cvf )

Take a note of the name used. It is likely to be GP38.cvf.

Go back to the Trainset/Common.cab/GreenClass20 folder and open the correct folder for your loco.

Copy the correctly named .cvf into the cabview folder.
These .cvf files are all the same so you can rename one if need be.

And thats it.

Copy the CABVIEW folder into your loco if need be, make a consist and drive your loco.


For other locos, just delete the contents of the existing Cabview folder and copy in the appropriate .cvf

NOTE FOR DRIVERS.

Just like the real thing, it can be hard to see signals when running nose first. You can get rid of the cabview altogether by holding down the shift key and pressing 1.
