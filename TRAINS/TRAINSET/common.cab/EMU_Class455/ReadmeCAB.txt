-------------------------------------------------------------
Install_1:
 1 Backup and delete an oroginal folder of [CABVIEW].
 2 Unzip [455cabV1.zip] and put the folder of [CABVIEW]
   into your trainset(ex.[BR455][CONNEX 455]...).

-------------------------------------------------------------
Install_2:
 This zip-file include arranged eng-file.
 This eng-file is [Electric] type. (Original is Diesel type.)

 * When replacing, in the route where the setting of an Electric
   railroad isn't done, it becomes not possible to this file to use.
  I recommend that you use in the L&SE route by Making Tracks.
  When it is unpleasant, make only install_1.
 
 1 Backup an original eng-file.
 2 Replace a changed eng-file with the original eng-file.
 3 Backup an original con-file. 
 4 Put into a new con-file into the folder of [consists].


-------------------------------------------------------------

   If you use common.cab

 1 Unzip [455cabV1.zip] and rename [CABVIEW] to [455cab].
 2 Put [455cab] into the folder of [common.cab].
 3 Put [class455C.cvf] into the folder of [CABVIEW] of your trainset.
 4 Change next line of eng-file.

   CabView ( xxxx.cvf ) ----->  CabView ( class455C.cvf )
