README FOR:  CLASS_59_66_CABVIEW_V01.zip and its archived files 
 
TO INSTALL:
1: unzip to a temp folder with "use folder names" on.

2: MAKE A FULL BACKUP OF THE LOCO YOU ARE GOING TO ADD THE CAB VIEW TO.

3: if the loco has a CABVIEW folder already then you should delete it or rename it, e.g. "CABVIEW.bak"
 
2: Go to the temp folder and copy & paste or drag & drop the folder "CABVIEW" to the folder of the loco you are going to use it with.

3: Open the .eng file of the loco that you are using and look for the "CabView" entry e.g. "CabView ( xxxxxxx.cvf )" .
This should be changed to "CabView ( JT42CWR.cvf )" .

4: you should now be able to use the cabview in MSTS, if you get any errors then if you followed step 2 you can just delete the modified locos folder and reinstate the unmodified backup folder, then retry or give up.
