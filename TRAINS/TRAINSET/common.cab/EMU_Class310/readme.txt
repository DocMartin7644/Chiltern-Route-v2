History.

The AM10, later Class 310 fleet were built for use on the 1965 extension of the Lm electrification into London and were principally used on Euston-Birmingham stopping services. The 50 sets were a derivative of the Mk2 coaching stock design and were built by BR at Derby. These sets were novel in a number of ways when introduced, incorporating disc brakes, which on the trailer vehicles operated against axle mounted disc plates. Fluorescent lighting was fitted and the general design was one of a modern state of the art train.
The sets remained working on the Euston route until displaced by more modern Class 321s.
