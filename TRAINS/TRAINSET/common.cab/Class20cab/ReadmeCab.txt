Cab installation:

Unzip Class20cab.zip to a temporary folder.
 
This will give you the opportunity to either install directly to the loco Cabview folder
or into the Common.cab folder.

Before you transfer any files, BACKUP then DELETE the contents of the cabview folder of the
loco you intend to use with this cab.

To install into loco Cabview folder, copy all the files into the Cabview folder.

To install into the Common.cab, make a new folder within the Common.cab folder named Class20cab

Copy all the files to the new Class20cab folder.

Copy the class20c.cvf, class20c_rv.cvf to your loco Cabview folder.

Check the Cabview ( xxxxxx.cvf ) parameter in the loco eng file:

Cabview installed: Eng file needs to be:     Cabview ( class20.cvf )

Common.cab installed: Eng file needs to be:  Cabview ( class20c.cvf )

The cabview has been setup for green locos, if you want to use the cabview with blue locos, substitute the
greenleft.ace for the blueleft.ace in the class20_rv.cvf and class20c_rv.cvf files.

Please note the rear view is only a view, driveable, but no controls or instrumentation.

Thank you for downloading; enjoy your new cab.
During the construction of this cab I would like to express my thanks to the following:

Barrow Hill Roundhouse for granting me permission to take photographs
and advice given with respecting the Class 20 loco operation and controls.
