Comments :         This cab is not an exact replica of a 421 cab, it is intended
                   to give a feeel for that type of cab
                   I would like to thank Dave Babb for his imput to this cab, he
                   Has helped to make it have a british feel, which will make the 
                   driving experiance better.

Installation :

                   Quite simply a self installer, you must however also download
                   the Class 421 and the sound package and install them.
