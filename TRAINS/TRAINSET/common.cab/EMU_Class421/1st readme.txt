Model :        All Class 421 ( 4 Cig,s )/ Cab/Sound 

Released:      22/03/2002

System setup:  Dave Babb

Comments:      This is an over view of how the system works, you download
               and install the cab and the sound packages, these will install
               to your trainset folder as common.cab and common.sound, if you
               already have Dave Babb's 170 cab then you will find that in the
               folder Common.cab, all the class 421's will alias to these two 
               folders which will save your hard disk space.
