Cab View for Class 03 and Class 04 Diesel Shunting locomotives v1.1 by Gary Price and Chris Baily
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This cabview was built specifically for the Class 03 and 04 Shunter models put together by various members of the UKTS community. Alan Salmon, Andy Dunett and myself visitied Chris Baily at the East Lancs Railway in Bury for a day and took lots of photos of cabs for this cabview.

The photos were taken inside the cab of the East Lancs Railway Class 03 Shunter 03062 and therefore complement the models very well.

As there is very little difference betweeen the 03 and 04 cabviews, you'll only notice the exhaust cowling missing on the 04 cabs. That's the only difference, but I've included it as it was easy to do.

For this cabview I've gone down the "common.cab" aliassing route to save people space, and to ensure that it will be compatible with more than just the one engine.

To make this cabview as authentic as possible (which isn't possible within the limits of MSTS) I used a Class 04 locomotive which I downloaded from http://www.uktrainsim.com I've included a revised eng file for this locomotive here in which everything is as prototypical as MSTS allows. To get the most from this cabview I recommend downloading and installing this locomotive, along with the small shunter sound set. See below for file names and IDs. Although the cabview should work with all the 03s and 04s.

What is and isn't included
-------------------------

A complete animated cab is included here, with forward, left and right views all from photographs taken inside 03062. The driving (main) view is forward along the nose from the right-hand side of the cab. This is the common driving position. For the left view, we've made another view forward along the nose, but from the left hand cab position. This should help with spotting signals etc. There are 2 different left hand views, one for the 03 with the exhaust cowling and one for the 04 without. The right-hand view is actually a view from the right-hand side of the cab but looking back through the rear windows to aid shunting. The major controls are all animated, that's the reverser, throttle, gears, horn and both loco and train brake systems. There are also full brake gauges, and  speedometer.

I have included an alias cvf file for use with both the Class 03 and Class 04 Shunter engines. These are in the common.cab\Class_03-04 folder and are called Class03.cvf and Class04.cvf respectively.

I've also included a modified 04 eng file for BR Class04 D2275 which has been modified to allow for the gears.

Those of you familiar with the real engines will notice some discrepancies here. The first and major one is that the real engine only has a two position reverser, neutral being provided by the gearbox. MSTS only allows for three position reversers, and so I've included a middle (neutral) position for the reverser here. Also, the light switches are all or nothing I'm afraid, as there's no easy way in MSTS to flick individual switches and light the corresponding lights.

Finally a word of warning. There is a bug in MSTS to do with geared engines. When put in reverse and any gear, you will find that the engine accelerates sharply to ridiculous speeds rather like a Ferrari, even with 0% throttle! I'm afraid there's not a lot we can do about that, so go careful when backing up to those consists. Best way is to choose reverse and 0% throttle with the gear lever in neutral, then select 1st gear, wait until you get to the speed you want and them knock the engine straight back to neutral again. I'm afraid this happens with all the geared engines I've tried, including the default Kiha 31!!


Installation
------------

1) Before starting, make a backup of your Trains\Trainset directory, just in case it all goes wrong. Chris and I can accept no responsibility for loss or damage to files on your system.

2) Make sure that you've downloaded and installed a Class 03 or 04 shunter. I recommend downloading br04_d2275.zip as I've included a modified eng file for this one.

   If you're using the D2275 04 recommended above and my modified eng file, you will also need to download and install the excellent Small Shunter sounds package by Stuart Williamson, in fact these are worth getting anyway. I've aliassed the eng file to the shunter sounds that use start-up and shut-down sounds, so remember to press the B key to start the engine before doing anything else when you're in the cab and remember to press B again when you've finished and parked the engine. ;-).

3) Now just unzip the contents of this zip file into your C: directory assuming you installed MSTS into it's default location. If you installed MSTS in a custom location, then you probably know enough about MSTS to be able to move the common.cab folder into your Trains\Trainset folder already (how's that for a cop-out?) ;-).

4) If you're using the D2275 04 recommended above, copy the br04_d2275.eng file to the ...\TRAINS\TRAINSET\BR04_D2275 folder.

5) Next copy the alias file (Class03.cvf for Class03 engines or Class04.cvf for 04s) from the Aliasses folder into your engine's cabview folder.

5) Finally you need to make sure that the eng file of the engine you're using is pointing to the correct cvf file. Using Wordpad or your favourite unicode editor, make sure that the eng file for the aliassed engine is pointing to the right cvf file:

   For all Class 03 shunters, the cabview entry should read:      CabView ( Class03.cvf )
   For all Class 04 shunters, the cabview entry should read:      CabView ( Class04.cvf )

This is already done in my modified eng file.
   
That's it. Now go and drive the engines... then let us know what you think.


Thank yous
----------

Extra special thanks go to the East Lancs Railway in Bury for allowing us to photograph this cabview. We had a great day at the railway. I'd thoroughly recommend a visit to any and everyone.

Special thanks to Chris who guided us around the railway and kept us safe!

Thanks to Stuart Williamson for his fantastic sound-set and Jonathan Olds for the Class 04 shunter.

Thanks to Chris Andy Dunnett and Alan Salmon for helping with the beta testing.

Lastly thanks yet again to Mrs Fodda for putting up with me hogging the main computer for hours at an end and forcing her to "Look at this!" every time a new animation was complete. ;-)


History
-------

v1.0 Complete cabview as uploaded to UKTS

v1.1 Replaced faulty Front.ace file which had the alpha channel the wrong way round. This only affected people using MSTS in 640x480 or 800x600 resolutions.


Notes
-----


You install this at your own risk. In fact, why not back up your Train Simulator directory before installing this in case it all goes pear-shaped? Mind you... it worked fine on my system.
