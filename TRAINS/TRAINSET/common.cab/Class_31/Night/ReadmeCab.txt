Cab installation:

Unzip 31nightcab.zip to a temporary folder.
 
This will give you the opportunity to either install directly to the loco cabview folder
or into the common.cab folder.

Before you transfer any files, BACKUP then DELETE the contents of the cabview folder of the
loco you intend to use with this cab.

To install into loco cabview folder, copy all the files into the cabview folder.

To install into the common.cab, make a new folder within the common.cab folder named Class31-1

Check the Cabview ( xxxxxx.cvf ) parameter in the loco eng file:
