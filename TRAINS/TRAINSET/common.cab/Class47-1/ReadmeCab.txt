Cab installation: Unzip Class47-1.zip to a temporary folder.

This will give you the opportunity to either install directly to the loco cabview folder
or into the common.cab folder.

Before you transfer any files, BACKUP then DELETE the contents of the cabview folder of the
loco you intend to use with this cab.

To install into loco cabview folder, copy all the files into the cabview folder.

To install into the common.cab, make a new folder within the common.cab folder named Class47-1
Copy all the files to the new Class47-1 folder.
Copy the Class47c.cvf and Class47c_rv.cvf files to your loco cabview folder.

Check the Cabview ( xxxxxx.cvf ) parameter in the loco eng file:

Cabview installed: Eng file needs to be:     Cabview ( Class47.cvf )
Common.cab installed: Eng file needs to be:  Cabview ( Class47c.cvf )

Thank you for downloading; enjoy your new cab.

and advice given with respecting the Class 31 loco operation and controls.
