INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

To install this cab view to any steam locomotive:

1. Unzip the contents onto your desktop. 

2. Copy or cut and paste the common.cab folder into the /TrainSimulator/Trains/Trainset/... folder. (You may wish to rename an existing CabView folder if you do not wish to overwrite the contents.)

3. Replace the cab view entry of the .eng file of the locomotive with the following line:
	CabView ( "..\\..\\common.cab\\Ben\\Ben.cvf" )

WARNING: If you wish to remove or replace this cab view please amend the CabView line of the .eng file as appropriate before removing or replacing the CabView folder or any of its contents.
