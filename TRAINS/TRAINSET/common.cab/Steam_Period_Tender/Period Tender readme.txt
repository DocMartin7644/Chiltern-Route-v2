Thank you for using this model, which is supplied for your personal use only, and may not be sold or distributed in any way other than as a Freeware item from UKTrainsim.com.

The model may be included in Freeware route CD packages, but only by specific prior written permission.

This Cab is identical to that included with the Skipton to Carlisle Route CD.  It was originally converted by me for that route from an earlier Wooden Cab by Richard Scott (Thanks, Richard), which was produced solely for MR livery use with his locos.  I butchered it to produce a dirty well used appearance. (so you know who to blame!!)

Basically, it the same as the Tank Cab I issued ages ago but has side views showing the roof edge to reinforce the "Tender" type cab roofline.


INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~


This Cab should be located in it's own folder called "PERIOD_METAL_TENDER_CAB" within a "common.cab" folder in the "Trainset" folder of your Train Simulator.

It aliases to numerous Scotsman files so this default loco must be present in it's normal place.

If you install as described below that's what you should get!

Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.
   

To install, Extract all the files in the archive into your Train Simulator folder, keeping the folder option turned on.  


To use this Cab in your own locos, you will need to change the cabview line in the .eng file to:-


    CabView (  "..\\..\\common.cab\\PERIOD_METAL_TENDER_CAB\\PERIOD_METAL_TENDER_CAB.cvf" )






WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.
