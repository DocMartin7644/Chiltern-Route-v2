DESCRIPTION:
 
This was originally sent to me by ASH888 in a primative form as he was stuck, he then passed it on to me to carry the mantle. I then attempted and managed to get the screen and background ready for the physics with a little help from sean to create the lower cab. Then via Jon Bilton and Stephen Hornsey they managed to achieve what you have here now. By using the controls from the 58 cabview that stephen made we have saved time. At a later date im sure if i bug stephen enough, he may be able to do a newer version with the correct controls.
I hope this is good enough to start with and you have fun using it.

There is one thing left and this is the most important bit. With out a certain forum members brothers' help this would not have been possible and i would like to thank Marcus B for his help (U know who u r:) )

His name has been removed to protect his job:)

i have included to cvf files one for a normal cab the other for a common cab.

If anyone would like to make an auto installer for this please email me at jonchampy@aol.com
