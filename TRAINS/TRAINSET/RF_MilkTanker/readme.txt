Great Western Railway Six Wheel 3000gal Milk Tank Wagon
Version 1.0 ( July 2007 )

3D Model built  by Reg Furniss

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 3D model has been built using TrainSim Modeler

A set of three six wheel 3000gal milk tank wagons.
Although the six wheel 13ft wheelbase with ( generally ) 20ft 6in underframe was adopted by all 
four of the grouping companies, numerous detailed differences are found between their respective
products.  These models represent wagons built to Diagram 049 and subsequent when the Dean
Churchward brake gear was changed to the ordinary lever hand brake.
Models include Co-op ( with exposed tank stapping ) and Express Dairies and West Park Dairy Co
with top cover to tanks.

Any suggestions of help or constructive comments welcome.
