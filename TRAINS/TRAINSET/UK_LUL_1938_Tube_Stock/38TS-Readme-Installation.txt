README - LT 1938 Tube Stock train V2.0 for MSTS.

This kit comprises a complete V2.0 version of the 1938 Tube Stock, originally released by Richard Scott and uploaded with his permission. It includes a new realistic 3D cab and controls, new sounds and lighting, accurate physics and prototypical consists. 
The authors are indebted to several 38TS Motormen who shared their knowledge and memories from "back in the day", and helped us to 'get it to work right'.
Thanks and credit are also due to District Dave for providing photographs of the LT Museum preserved 1938 Tube Stock train, and details of its cab and controls.

INSTALLATION

If you already have the original 38TS installed, it may be best to delete the 1938 TUBE STOCK folder first. All the files have been changed in this version and several new ones added. The eng/wag files have also had name changes to as not to be confused with those distributed with add-in CDs. New consist files referencing these eng/wag files are also included. You will need to edit any activities you have that use the 'old' consist files and re-define any player or AI services using the new consists.

To install, simply Unzip this V2 kit to your MSTS top-level folder, ensuring that the winzip option "use folder names" is checked.

The train will install into: <MSTS-FOLDER>/TRAINS/TRAINSET/1938 TUBE STOCK

Important note:

Note that the 1938 TUBE STOCK/Sounds folder will contain 4 SMS files and only 4 WAV files (new sounds unique to this stock). The SMS files also alias various WAV sound files of the LUL CO/CP V2 train. You must therefore have the CO/CP train installed. This greatly reduced the size of this kit, and will also save you disk space. The CO/CP V2.0 train can be obtained from UKTS as file # 2955, and the CO/CP V2.3 update as file # 5456.

What you get in this kit:

3 consists are included, and will be automatically put in your MSTS-FOLDER>/TRAINS/CONSISTS folder. 
They are named LT 38TS 7car, LT 38TS 7car EP, and LT 38TS 7car WP. You can select each different consist from the MSTS Locomotive selection drop-down list when starting an activity or route exploration. The names displayed are the same as the filenames. The 3 consists exist as 3 different braking systems were implemented to suit a range of 'Motorman skills':

1. An EP system (without graduated release due to a Kuju bug), but with realistic duplex brake gauge operation.
2. A 'faked' EP system that has graduated release using the engine brakes, but has a disfunctional duplex brake guage (may be easiest for novices to use).
3. A Westinghouse-only system for die-hard Motormen, with realistic operation and gauges.


An illustrated 38TS VIRTUAL MOTORMAN'S GUIDE (an MS Word Document) is included, and after installation can be found in the 1938 TUBE STOCK folder. You may wish to read it before driving this new 38TS train, as the cab has very different controls and gauges compared to other MSTS LUL Stocks! Operation of the 3 brake systems is described in detail in the Guide.
