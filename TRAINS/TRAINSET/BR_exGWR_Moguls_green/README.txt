BR Green Liveried Mogul Multipack
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is a multipack of BR Green liveried moguls.

All these locos were allocated to Machynlleth or Croes Newydd depots. This pack has been made with activity creation on the Cambrian and Bala Hub routes in mind.  However they will look nice on any exGWR secondary/Branch line setting.

There are some unlined green versions and some are lined.  There is also a lined and unlined tender.

Thanks to Robin for allowing thse reskins, and Richard Gibb for making a new eng file for it.  Be-aware the brakes are more realistic than most GWR train sim locos, to release them you need to open the ejector (j key)

To instal, just unzip to the following directory:


C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\TRAINS\TRAINSET

To use this loco, Stuart Williamson's GWR soundset must be installed, which is available on UKTS, file id: 6481.

Locos with a # prefix are computer controlled and used in traffic consists.

Then create a consists and away you go!
