Thank you for downloading this model, which is of a Rowsley loco (Peak District)...as it formerly shunted the Beeston yards on a long turn from Nottingham, it had been fitted with extra coal rails, I doubt Rowsley complained!! 

This model is for your personal use only, and may not be sold or distributed in any way.

This is a model of the archtypical LMS, later BR (LMR), 0-6-0 Tank Loco.

When Fowler became CME of the LMS, he chose to improve the loco stock of the company by drawing heavily on Midland designs, in some cases with minimal changes, as with this loco.

Built between 1924 and 1930, they eventually numbered 422, so there was no real surprise that you could bump into one almost anywhere on LMS metals from big sheds to little branch lines, yards, station pilots, and bankers. They were even used as Pilots at times (there's a famous pic of 47496 piloting a West Country on the "Pines Express"!!)

In later BR days they spread in small numbers all over the system, and out of BR service to Collieries, etc.

The last few were withdrawn by BR in 1967. 

As with any loco with a long service life, variations abounded, far beyond that practical to model in MSTS. Some were modified for Push Pull working, some were without Vacuum Braking, some had condensing gear, and over time they carried different fittings such as chimneys, etc.

We hope that in this single basic model we have captured the essence of what was a very successful, wide ranging and well liked workhorse.  

Intended only to be a reasonable representation, it's not hugely detailed, so not too frame rate draining for low spec systems...........if you'd like a more detailed version from us, please let me know.


INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

The .eng file in this archive is set up to alias Kuju's Scotsman sound and cab by default.    

Step 1. In the \TRAINS\TRAINSET directory, create a new directory called BR_3FTank_47629.

Step 2. Now extract all the files in the archive into this directory, keeping the folder option turned on.


You are now ready to create a consist containing this model by using the Activity Editor
supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator - the model will not be available in the simulator unless you do this.

Please be aware that this model may or may not be compatible with all the rolling stock that you have available. By default it has Chain couplings.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.
