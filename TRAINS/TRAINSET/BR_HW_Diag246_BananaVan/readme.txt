HISTORY
~~~~~~~
The first BR banana vans had been a continuation of the LMS type and it was not until 1959 that a new design, based on the standard van, appeared.
When the use of rail began to decrease these vans spent a lot of time in store but because their steam heating meant that they were well sealed, this also kept the damp out and they became popular as stores vans. Some can still be found in internal use today. 
INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

Unzip to a temporary folder and copy, move or drag to your Trainset folder.

You are now ready to create a consist containing this model by using the Activity Editor
supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator - the model will not be available in the simulator unless you do this.

Please be aware that this model may or may not be compatible with all the engines and rolling stock that you 
have available.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.
