The contents of this zip file are the copyright of Paul Mitchell February 2006.
You may use the contents for non commercial use. If you want to re-skin go right ahead.

Unzip the contents of the zip file into the trains folder the default path of which is c:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\Trains\Trainset. If using win zip or similar providing you have 'use folder names' ticked the contents should end up in a Sub folder called BR_9F_92215 or BR_9F_92215 depending on version you are installing. If you use the built in compression in Windows XP just open up the zip file and drag the folder into c:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\Trains\Trainset. Now create a consist, I use ConBuilder, you should be up and running. The model uses default cab and sounds for the Scotsman so that needs to be installed.

Be warned the model has a high poly count. The cabplus is a freight anim which adds the cab interior plus bits and pieces of additional detail which I couldn't get into the main model. More importantly this also adds the cab overhang which fits over the top of the front of the tender. There are two versions one with headlamp codes for an unfitted freight and the other for a fitted freight. The engine files are also different the unfitted version is from some information posted by supergoods on the Physics forum, be careful the non fitted version will not move if you have fitted stock in the consist.


The model was made with TSM and polymaster.

Thanks to Jon Bilton for testing.

Hope you enjoy it
