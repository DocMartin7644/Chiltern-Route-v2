Railway Workers for activities.
-------------------------------

This is a small development kit which facilitates the addition of static railway workers scenery as placeable items in activities.

The following files are needed for this kit to work properly.

UKTS_7920_Invisiwag 
UKTS_23996_RF_Workmen

1. Extract the files from this zip and place the RF_Workmen folder in the TRAINSET directory.

2. Unzip UKTS_7920_Invisiwag to a temporary folder and copy invisiwag.s and invisiwag.sd to the RF_Workmen folder.

3. Unzip UKTS_23996_RF_Workmen to a temporary folder and copy everything from both the SHAPES and TEXTURES folders into RF_Workmen.

4. Copy the demo consist to your consists folder and add your railway workers to your activities as a loose consist definition.

Two folders have been included under RF_Workmen to keep copies of consists and .wags for developing new variants and dodging around Trainstore. If you want to create new variations, please rename the files being altered , mainly to avoid confusion at a later date, and especially if you are going to upload new activities to the site.

I have produced a simple set of characters in the demo consist. Please feel free to experiment and change distances, positions and so on.

Please respect modellers copyrights.
