replacement engine sounds for Spuddy Mcfuddy's(Paul Woddroffe's) Class 26 & 33 Diesel Locomotives

Hi all, these files will replace the GP38 sounds in the sound folders of your Classes 26 & 33 Locomotives in
Microsoft Train Simulator, giving it a more realistic UK feel to it.
I have tried them with very good results.

Instructions for use:

1.Locate your Class 26/33 sound folder in the Trains, Trainset folder of Microsoft Train Simulator.
2.Extract the enclosed files to the Class 26/33 sound folder, and overwrite when prompted, thats all.
3.Start Train Simulator select a Class 26/33 Consist, to hear the new engine and horn sounds.

Disclaimer:

Whilst I have tried these files on my machine with no problems, I accept no damage which they may cause, use at your own risk.


Limitations:

These files will only work if you use the whole GP38 sound folder for your Class 26/33, not an alias.


Copyright:

Feel free to edit and modify these files all I ask is you give me a mention.
