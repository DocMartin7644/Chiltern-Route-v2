Version 1

Released : 11-10-2018

Model    : Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.

The Leeds Forge Introduced a patent 25ton ballast hopper in 1911.
This had side and bottom doors operated by handwheels at the side of one end.
7 were supplied to the SECR.
Operating the doors from the side while the wagon was moving was hazzardous and in 1915 design was changed by extending the underframe at one end and shortening the hopper to provide a platform for the operator.
7 more were ordered by the SECR with additional side drop doors.
Thr LMS ordered 20 in 1926.
The LNER obtained 30 in 1929 with further orders until 145 were in use by 1947. 
In 1949 BR ordered 113 to the same design to diagram 580.

All were unfitted. Some recieved vacuum or air through pipes but most were scrappedby the mid 80s.
