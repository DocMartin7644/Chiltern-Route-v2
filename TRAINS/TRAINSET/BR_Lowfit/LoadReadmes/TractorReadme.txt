Early model Farmall tractor and square hay baler.

Includes separate tractor, combined tractor and haybaler, separate baler set up for towing and a single square hay bale free with every purchase.
Tractor-baler combination has been set up so that it 'disappears' when the route is operated outside of summer mode.
