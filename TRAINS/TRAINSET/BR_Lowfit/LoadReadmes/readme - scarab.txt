HISTORY
~~~~~~~
This Zip contains:

BR Scammell, plus trailer, as vehicles, alone and together, and a parked trailer.

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
I assume nothing.  However, before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in your chosen route's directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

Unzip all the .S and .SD files into the shapes directory of your chosen route.
Unzip the ACE files into the textures directory. 

Open the route ref file using WORDPAD.
( Normally - Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\ROUTES\your route\routename.ref )
Add the following lines of text:

Static (
    Class           ( Vehicles )
    Filename        ( BR_Scammel_Scarab.s )
    Align           ( None )
    Description     ( BR_Scammel_Scarab )
)

Static (
    Class           ( Clutter )
    Filename        ( Scarab_Trailer_Box_Parked.s )
    Align           ( None )
    Description     ( Scarab_Trailer_Box_parked )
)

Static (
    Class           ( Vehicles )
    Filename        ( BR_Scammel_Scarab_Box_Trailer.s )
    Align           ( None )
    Description     ( BR_Scammel_Scarab_Box_Trailer )
)

Save and exit WORDPAD.

You are now ready to add the models to the route using the Route Editor
supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator - the models will not be available in the simulator unless you do this.

These models can be found under various headings.

Instructions on how to use the MSTS Route Editor may be found in tutorials on the Internet.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.

THANKS
