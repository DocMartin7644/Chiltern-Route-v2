Place the ace files in the textures folder for your route, the .s and .sd files in the shapes folder for your route.  Copy the contents of Your Ref into the ref file for your route using Wordpad.  Copy the files only for those objects you wish to use.

These objects are for you to use however you wish.  You may improve them, destroy them or whatever.  You may distribute them if you have altered them and you can give me credit for the basic design if you want but you don't have to.
