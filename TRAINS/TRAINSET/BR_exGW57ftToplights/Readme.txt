Thank you for downloading these models
These fourteen coaches represent a varied range of stock typifying GWR Edwardian practice.    They were built during the period 1907 - 23, a number lasting into BR days. During their existence they were, typically used in formation that included varying types including the Concertinas, Dreadnoughts, later GWR stock and BR Mk1s.  They are seen in their BR condition,the non-corridor stock being all over crimson livery and the corridor stock being in blood and custard livery.  The restaraunt car is also provided in BR Maroon livery as som laster late enough to receive this livery.
Included are two types of the non-corridor version, both having two versions with different running numbers.
