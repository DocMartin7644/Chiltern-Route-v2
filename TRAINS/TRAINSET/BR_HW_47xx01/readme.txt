Notes
~~~~~
New shape files to stop the locos sliding when run in reverse.

Taken me a long time to crack this one and you won't believe how I finally cured it. :)

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

ONLY attempt this installation if you fully understand the following:-

Copy each of the new shape files into the relevant folders in your trains directory allowing them to overwrite the existing ones.

You are now ready to create consists containing these models by using the Activity Editor
supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator - the models will not be available in the simulator unless you do this.

Please be aware that these models may or may not be compatible with all the rolling stock that you have available.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.
