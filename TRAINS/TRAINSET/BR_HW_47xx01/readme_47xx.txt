INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

NOTE:  This model does NOT require files to be copied from the SCOTSMAN locomotive directory as both sound and cabviews have been aliased.

ONLY attempt this installation if you fully understand the steps below.

Step 1. In the \TRAINS\TRAINSET directory, create a new directory BR47xx01.
Step 2. Now extract all the files listed above into the directory as noted.

You are now ready to create consists containing these models by using the Activity Editor
supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator - the models will not be available in the simulator unless you do this.

Please be aware that these models may or may not be compatible with all the rolling stock that you have available.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.
