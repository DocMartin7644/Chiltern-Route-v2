The Flying Dustbins Multipack

Furstly many thanks to Reg Furniss and Bob Pegg for allowing the reskinning to produce this pack.
Reg built the original model of 33001 for Bob's Steyning Route and all nine of these locos are derived from that.

The nine BR Class Q1 Bulleid Locos have allocations in London, Guildford, Three Bridges, Eastleigh and Tonbridge making them suitable for use in steam or early electric activities in any of the Southern Region Routes.

These weird looking locos were built during the second world war to cope with increased freight traffic on the Southern Region.They were the UK's most powerful 
o-6-0 locomotive.

Their strange appearance meant they had various nicknames Ugly Ducklings, Flying Dustbins and Charlies (because they looked like right Charlies).

They remained in service on the Southern Ragion (although I'm sure I saw some of them  on the North London Line) up to the mid 1960's.
