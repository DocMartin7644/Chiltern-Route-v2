Brief History
-------------

The 2251 Class was designed by Charles Collett as a development of the similar Dean Goods 0-6-0 Locomotives.  Despite their name they were a very useful mixed traffic design of locomotive and lasted until the mid 1960s.

Represented here are 3 of the type in BR Green livery as seen during the 1950s and 60s, all locos are appropriate to the Cambrian and Bala Hub Routes.

Thanks to Tim Booth for giving us the original superb model and adapting his loco for this livery, and allowing me to upload these repaints

All use the same tender file.

Installation.
-------------

1 You must have Stuart Williamson's GWR locos sound pack (UKTS File ID 6481) installed for these locos to work

2 Run the self install programme

Then create a consists in the activity editor and you're away!  remember they use the same tender! I have included player driveable and non-player driveable locos for each engine so that they can be used correctly in activities.

Thanks for downloading these locos.
