LT 1938 Stock

This model represents the 1938 Stock built as part of London Transport's New Works programme. They ran on the Piccadilly, Northern, Bakerloo and Central lines. They lasted very nearly 50 years on London Transport. After which some units had a new lease of life as 2 car units on the Isle of Wight, where they replaced pre 1938 Standard stock (also ex LT) and still run today. In LT days they could run as 2, 3, 4, 7 or (sometimes) 9 car units. Sometimes trains would be made up of combinations of these. The consist supplied is of a 7 coach train made up of a 4 and a 3 car train. A 'real' simulator of the train can be found at the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden, London, who also have a coach preserved.

The model has been built in 3DCanvas 6 and features, driver, passenger view and illuminated destination blinds. 

The model uses an alias to the Series 2000 cab, not really accurate I know, but it will do for now.  I have taken some liberties with the eng file to give it, at least what appears to be, reasonable performance. If anyone would like to work on making the eng file more realistic I would be more than happy. That's not a strong point of mine. Or, indeed, if someone would like to make the sounds more accurate, please feel free.

Thanks to Tim Hubbard for giving the model the once over and to Vern Moorhouse and Jimi Ibbetts for encouragement. 

If you want to find out more then I can recommend the book:

'The 1938 Tube Stock' by Piers Connor, published by Capital Transport

Hope you enjoy the model.

Installation

Unzip to C: the folders and files should then be installed in the correct place. I have included a 7 coach consist as well, so you should be ready to go!
