3DTRAINS ADDON FOR MICROSOFT TRAIN SIMULATOR
Diesel Smoke Image Replacement v1.0
File Date: 03.10.06
____________________________________________________________________________________________
INSTALLATION & FILE NOTES

Make a backup of the DIESELSMOKE.ACE file (copy to a temporary folder in the event you wish
to use the old texture), located in the Train Simulator\Global\Textures folder.

Start the self-installer by double-left-clicking, and when prompted, browse to the Train
Simulator folder on your PC. MSTS is typically installed to the following directory:

	C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator

If this matches your installation of MSTS, then you don't need to browse or go looking for
the MSTS folder. Just accept the prompts in the self-installer, and once finished, simply
start MSTS and check out the new smoke effects on your favorite diesel. Medium smoke is used
as default - for a lighter or heavier smoke effect, simply use the included batch files to
switch vesrions. :)

If you have any issues with the enclosed files, please post a note on the 3DTrains forums:

Or you can email me: mnelson@3dtrains.com

Cheers!
